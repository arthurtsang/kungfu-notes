# Advanced Purple Belt

## Clawing Panther

1. attacker right hand punch to the face
2. left foot forward into fighting stance, right hand outward parry and left hand soft hand block to elbow.
  both hand making a small arc in front of the face and finish on the side  
  turning the body and to the chest, winding up and ready for the next strike just like raising knee.
  pull down the outward parry is to pull the attacker forward and expose their neck.
3. along attacker hand, right hand ridge hand to the throat, left hand at guard
4. right hand u-hand grab the throat, left hand grab the shoulder while right knee to the groin.
  make sure to pull in close to your center.
5. snake left foot behind the attacker into a cross step so foot is sideway beind the attacker's heel.
  make sure you have balance and in control.  
  (don't just put left foot forward, move in and take his space.
  maenwhile, control the attacker by "pushing" him forward (backward for him) and close to the chest.)
  the attacker lost his balance
6. pull up right leg with attacker's leg, and extend backward horizontally (body also bend forward horizontally, kinda like the yoga post)
  both hands slam the attacker down and forward.
  putting all these together smoothly is to pull the already unbalanced attacker's leg and push the body at the same time.
  the attacker fell backward
7. right foot heel stomp into his groin, make sure put all weight onto the stomping foot.
  don't just put right foot forward, your center should be over the stomping leg and his groin, with all force going into it.
  attacker's head pops up.
8. left foot forward snap kick.  
  he is on the ground with head popped up, it's a low kick.  keep your supporting leg bended.
   attacker's head went back down, exposing his neck.
9. left foot knife edge stomp to the throat.  
  unlike heal stomp where we just shift our weight to the stomping leg, we jump and landing with one leg.
  when performing in the air, put the whole foot down instead but make sure it's cutting in from the side and notice the orientation of your foot.
10. turn the body and foot 90 to the right, twisting the throat.  stepping back into a 70/30 (not cat stance)
11. cat cover

## Leap of Death

1. attacker right hand punch to the face
2. left foot forward into fighting stance, right hand outward parry to grab and left hand heel hand to the elbow
3. left hand continue to heel hand rake, raking down along the attacker's hand to meet the right hand.
4. left hand back knuckle fist to the ribs (under the armpit) and grab the tricep.
  not the whole arm, only the tricep and dig in your fingers.
5. pull both hands close to center, left foot, through center, turn backward into a hard bow, while holding on to attacker's arm.
  the attacker lost balance and face plant to the ground. (a bit to the side or directly in front?)
6. bring both foot together and jumping double heel stomps to the kidneys.
  jump high and the feet of the stomp are apart a bit to hit both of the kidneys at the same time.
  the attacker's head/chest pops up
7. jump into a horse stance so not standing on his body anymore.
  grab attacker's shoulders with both hands, and bend both knee inward and knee to the shoulder blade.  
  attacker should start falling back to the ground, but before that happens,
8. back to horse stance, lean forward to grab behind his head/chin with right hand while left hand chamber up high
9. left hand strike down to his throat and right hand pull out from underneath turning his head to his right to chamber up high
  turn into a broken bow facing the right
  this gives the power to the neck break.
  make sure to not over reach by leaning foward or straightening the hand, the hand should be hitting with the side of the palm.
10. back to horse stance, right hand chop to the face, snap back and left hand to guard.
11. left foot step to the side of his head, right foot leap over to 45 lining up to the attacker's head, in position for a back leg round house kick

  both attackers lurches forward (closer to you)
  for dummy on the left, make sure your thumb are not trapped, releae the grip when being counter grab.
3. come up and right foot (the one stepped behind) thrust kick to the knee of the attacker on the right.

2. right foot foward into bow stance
  both hands comes from the middle (between attacker's arms) and flick to the eyes

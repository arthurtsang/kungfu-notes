# Advanced Purple Belt

## Clawing Panther

1. attacker right hand punch to the face
2. left foot forward into fighting stance, right hand outward parry and left hand soft hand block to elbow.
  both hand making a small arc in front of the face and finish on the side  
  turning the body and to the chest, winding up and ready for the next strike just like raising knee.
  pull down the outward parry is to pull the attacker forward and expose their neck.
3. along attacker hand, right hand ridge hand to the throat, left hand at guard
4. right hand grab the throat, left hand grab the shoulder while fight knee the groin
5. snake left foot behind the attacker into a cross step so foot is sideway beind the attacker's heel.
  maenwhile, control the attacker by "pushing" him forward (backward for him) and close to the chest
  the attacker lost his balance
6. pull up right leg with attacker's leg, and extend backward horizontally (body also bend forward horizontally, kinda like the yoga post)
  both hands slam down the attacker.
  putting all these together smoothly is to pull the already unbalanced attacker's leg and push the body at the same time.
  the attacker fell backwar
7. right foot heel stomp into his groin, make sure put all weight onto the stomping foot
   attacker's head pops up
8. left foot forward snap kick.  attacker's head went back down, exposing his neck.
9. left foot knife edge stomp to the throat.  unlike heal stop where we just shift our weight to the stomping leg, we jump and landing with one leg.
10. turn the body and foot 90 to the right, twisting the throat.  stepping back into a 70/30 (not cat stance)
11. cat cover

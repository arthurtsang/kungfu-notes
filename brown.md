2. forward snap kick to the head of the front attacher.
3. counter grip the one on right, right foot step into "cross step" (like in knee swipe, which step backward)

4. power thrust kick to the knee (right knee) of the left attacker
5. turn around to the right attacker (the counter grip should brought him down a bit and stepped closer to you)

  and hammer fist to the elbow (to control him and brought him down even more for the next move)
